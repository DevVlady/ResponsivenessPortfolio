        <p>Point and purpose is the key to understanding types of paragraphs and kinds of paragraphs.
            In writing, the words point and purpose are almost synonymous. Your point is your purpose, and how you
            decide to make your point clear to your reader is also your purpose. Writers have a point and a purpose for
            every paragraph that they create.
            Writers write descriptive paragraphs because their purpose is to describe something. Their point is that
            something is beautiful or disgusting or strangely intriguing. Writers write persuasive and argument
            paragraphs because their purpose is to persuade or convince someone. Their point is that their reader should
            see things a particular way and possibly take action on that new way of seeing things. Writers write
            paragraphs of comparison because the comparison will make their point clear to their readers.
            The purpose of Pattern Based Writing: Quick & Easy Essay is to quickly and easily teach students how to
            organize information and make points clear. Then in the Writing with Purpose section of the writing program,
            students learn to apply their new writing strategies to different types, kinds, genres, and modes of
            writing. The truth is that it’s quick and easy to get students to write many different types of paragraphs
            when they have the right foundation.
            Put simply, all of the different types and kinds of paragraphs simply involve layering on a different
            purpose or intent. When students have the right foundation, it’s just that simple. What are you trying to
            achieve in this paragraph and in your whole composition? What is your purpose right here? Do you wish to
            describe? Do you want to evaluate? Is your goal to narrate? Is your intent to persuade?.</p>
