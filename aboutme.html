                            <img src="./Assets/Images/Business Photo.jpg" alt="Business Photo" class="img-thumbnail">
                            <p>An ambitious individual, born in Bulgaria and moved to the states in August of 2001. Since moving
                                to the states, I have resided in the state of Minnesota and I love it.</p>
                            <p>I grew up in Minnetonka/Excelsior area and until recently have spent the last 7 years in
                                the northwest metro area. Graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Marketing from
                                Metropolitan State University in St. Paul, MN.</p>
                            <p>In the last 10 years of my career, I have been in banking and finance where I held
                                several roles, everything from bank teller to personal/small business banker. As I
                                continued my career in banking and the more thought I put into it, I knew that I did not
                                want to remain in retail banking. Shortly after graduating, my passion for computers,
                                design, and technology started to grow. I was more and more eager to learn about how
                                things worked and what it takes to make things run behind the scene. I decided to take
                                things into my own hands and started to research how programs work and what it takes to
                                make them function the way they do. I came across the Codecademy website and gave the
                                free trial a chance and since then, I have wanted to pursue a computer science degree
                                and wasn’t sure how and when I should get started. Life got busy and then 2020 happened
                                and I thought, what better time than now to switch careers so I went for it. I left my
                                old career behind and went on to pursue coding Bootcamp and obtain the education I need
                                to become a Web Developer.</p>
                            <p>Currently, I am attending coding Bootcamp at Rutgers, the University of New Jersey, and
                                already one week in, I can't get enough. My passion for coding and design is growing
                                every day. Following this program, I cant wait to obtain my dream job as a web developer
                                where I can utilize my creativity and put my passion to work at a growing organization.
