# ResponsivenessPortfolio

* This is a portfolio webpage showcasing my projects along with all other inforamtion about me.

    * First step in creating this portfolio was by building the skeleton of the webpage and general html code.
    * Then added my sections in order to add content.
    * Utilized bootstrap to make things more streamlined and easier for the page to respond.
    * There were 3 html files, which was each page with its own content but eventually after some thinking i added the home page.
    * After a number of edits i was able to get the page design to look presentable with a header and footer and very minimal content in the body.

* After getting the sections finalized i had worked on the about me page where it held my info.

    * I did some changes for a while before getting the final result i wanted. I figured once i get my main code to work then i am able to use that for some of my other pages as well with very little tweaking.
    * One main thing that took some time was the styling to ensure that everything was exactly where i wanted it to be.
    * Utilizing CSS to ensure that everyting was exactly how i want it to look.

* Once finished with the main webpage where it had everything that was required based on the instructions page, i was now going to put my creativity to work.

    * It took me a lot of research, trial and error before i was able to put some nice designs on my page and have the buttons appear how i wanted them to look.

* My current webpage works very smoothly and all links are working.

    * I put some touches to reflect what page you are currently on so thats its easy to the visitor
    * I also added my github and linkedin profile and made sure the webpages work properly.
    * This page is going to be a work in progress for time to come as i want to keep adding more features to this page as we learn more in class.
